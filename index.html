<h3> what happened when i was a child </h3>


  <p>I was born April 4th, 2002. When I was little I had a easy life. There wasn't ever anything much I had to do. All I basically ever did was go to school, eat, go outside, and then sleep. I had a good life as a child and I loved to play football and I wanted to meet my favorite singer and football player from all time, which was Aaron Rodgers<a href="http://www.packers.com/">aaron rodgers</a>, and Five finger death punch. All my life i had lived in Sanford, North Carolina.<p/>

<p>Right now I am in school and I have a normal life as any other person. I go to J.L. Mann highschool and I have seven classes. But as of rightnow I am in computer class. I am so ready to go to lunch because I am starving. But next I go to art class which somtime can be boring. So after there I get to go to lunch and get what I get every day which is a chicken sandwich. Then I finish the rest of my classes. I like to play xbox, but I dont play that often. I like to go outside.</p>
